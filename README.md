# whatsapp_automation
Now you need not type messages in whatsapp rather make your own whatsapp bto with just 2 lines of python code!!
I have done it by using Pycharm which is an python code editor.
In the first I have written **pip install pywhatkit** in the terminal and pressed the enter button.
Then at the first of the code I have imported pywhatkit.
Then I have written pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg('+91 **********', '****THE MESSAGE YOU WANT TO SEND').
And now you can snd automatic sed whatsapp message without typing!!
